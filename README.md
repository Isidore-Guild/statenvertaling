# Statenvertaling *with Apocrypha* (OSIS)

The idea is to have a solid base Statenvertaling module, to which the Apocrypha can be added optionally.

## Statenvertaling (base)
Since the source of the official Sword module is unavailable, I have constructed an alternative base for the Statenvertaling without Apocrypha. In its current state, it compiles to a SWORD module without errors or warnings.

### Lacking from my new OSIS file that is present in the official module:
* Chapter headings

### New features I have been able to add:
* Strong’s Numbers
* Words added to the translation are marked with transChange (these appear in Italics in the printed text)


### To be fixed
* The diaereses on e (ë) seem to have gone missing. I have compiled a list of verses with ë from the official module, which I will reduce to a list of words using ë.


### Other differences:
* I have elected to mark the original versification in square brackets for now.

## Apocrypha
Strong’s Numbers are absent, for obvious reasons. Additions to Esther have been made to fit the KJV versification, in the one chapter where there were too many verses. I should have a look at the other Apocyphra as well.
