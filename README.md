# Statenvertaling *with Apocrypha* (OSIS)

The idea is to have a solid base Statenvertaling module, to which the Apocrypha can be added optionally.

## Statenvertaling (base)
Since the source of the official Sword module is unavailable, I have constructed an alternative base for the Statenvertaling without Apocrypha. In its current state, it compiles to a SWORD module without errors or warnings.

### Lacking from my new OSIS file that is present in the official module:
* Chapter headings

### New features I have been able to add:
* Strong’s Numbers
* Words added to the translation are marked with transChange (these appear in Italics in the printed text)

### Other differences:
* I have elected to mark the original versification in square brackets for now.

## Apocrypha
Strong’s Numbers are absent, for obvious reasons. 

### Still to be added
* Additions to Esther
